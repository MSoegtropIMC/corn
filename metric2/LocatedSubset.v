* Located subsets

A subset Y : X -> Prop of a metric space X is located when its distance
function, fun x:X => d(x,Y), constructively exists. It is the generalization
to continuous spaces of the computable subsets of the natural numbers.
We cannot use the characteristic functions instead, because they are discontinuous.

When X has dimension 2, a located subset of X can be drawn on a raster,
ie a pixel grid. For each pixel, compute whether the distance of Y to
the center of the pixel is less than the size of the pixel. If so,
switch the pixel on otherwise leave it off.

With our ball-based definition of metric space, this translates as a
decidable sumbool.
